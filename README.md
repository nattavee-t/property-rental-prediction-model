# Certification Case Study - Property Rental Prediction Model

This project is part of Datacamp's Professional Data Scientist Certification process.

### Project Background:

Assuming, I have been hired by an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties for short stays. Currently, the webpage for renters has a conversion rate of 2%. This means that most people leave the platform without signing up.

The product manager would like to increase this conversion rate. They are interested in developing an application to help people estimate the money they could earn renting out their living space. They hope that this would make people more likely to sign up.

### Objective:

Built property rental prediction model to estimate money user could earn renting out their living space. Estimated price should not be more than 25 dollars off of the actual price.

I will need to present your findings in two formats:
- I must submit a written report summarising your analysis to technical audience that has a strong technical background and wants to understand what you have done and why. 
- I will then need to do a 10 minute presentation. The presentaion should be targeted at non-technical audience with no data science background but is familiar with basic data related terminology.
